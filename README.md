## Introduction

  This project involves building a running web server instance in `Amazon Web Services` and deploying a simple html application on it using ansible tool.
  
## Creating an instance in AWS:
	
Here are steps to be followed to create a running instance in AWS.

* Create an AWS account if not already exist
* Login to the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/) using your credentials.
* Go to Services tab and select EC2 under Compute group.
* Follow the simple instructions specified in console or refer [amazon EC2](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/gs-step-one-create-ec2-resources.html) to create an amazon EC2 instance.
* Make sure to use the right details such as instance type,region and security rules while creating the instance.

## Security:

   In order to secure the application from public access, you need to generate a SSL certificate and update apache configuration to reflect it. We generated a self signed certificate and updated apache configuration as below.

```
<VirtualHost ec2-13-58-188-253.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:443>
	DocumentRoot /var/www/html/sample/
	SSLEngine  on
	SSLCertificateFile /etc/httpd/conf/mysitename.crt
	SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/httpd/conf/mysitename.key
</VirtualHost>
```
Edit the apache configuration file `httpd.conf` to redirect http requests to https.

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    	ServerName ec2-13-58-188-253.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
     	Redirect / https://ec2-13-58-188-253.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
</VirtualHost> 
```

## Deployment:

Once you have the instance created, just run the ansible script using anisble playbook as below.

`ansible-playbook â€“i hosts sre_demo.yml`

   This will install the web server, copies all dependencies such configuration file, certs, keys and deploys the html application on it.

## Testing:

   The ansible script `sre_demo.yml` includes a task to execute the shell script `hello.sh` which will validates the server configurations and the application accessibility.

   If the application is reachable, then it will responds with `Hello, You accessed me Sucessfully!!` message. Otherwise it will responds with `Hello, You cant access me now. Somthing seems to be wrong!!!!!` message.
